# superpermutations-in-sed

A sed script to find a superpermutation of a given alphabet. It uses a greedy algorithm
closely resembling "The City Names Game", but taking the permutations of some alphabet
instead of cities and matching, if needed, more than one letter in cities' names.

See superpermutations.sed for details.
